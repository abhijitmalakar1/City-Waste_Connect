# Introduction
CityWaste Connect is an innovative IoT solution designed to streamline waste collection processes and enhance the efficiency of waste management in urban areas. The project leverages dedicated hardware components and a web-based control panel to create a seamless and automated waste collection experience for both municipalities and waste collectors.
# Features
•	Automated Waste Collection: The system enables waste collectors to efficiently manage waste collection routes and schedule pickups based on real-time data from waste generators.
•	RFID Tag Scanning: Each waste generator is equipped with an RFID tag fixed at their doorstep. The dedicated hardware scans these tags during collection visits, ensuring accurate and accountable waste tracking.
•	Web-based Control Panel: The control panel is accessible via web browsers, providing waste management personnel with an intuitive interface to monitor collection activities, track routes, and manage data.
•	Real-time Data: CityWaste Connect delivers real-time data on collection activities, including timestamps, locations, and the status of each collection point.
•	Efficient Routing: The system optimizes collection routes, minimizing travel time and fuel consumption for waste collectors.

# Hardware Components
The hardware components used in the CityWaste Connect project include:
•	Microcontroller: Responsible for controlling the various hardware modules and communication with the web application.
•	RFID Module: Used to scan RFID tags placed at waste generator doorsteps, ensuring accurate identification.
•	SIMCOM 4G LTE Chip: Enables the device to access the internet via M2M cards, facilitating real-time data transmission.

# Software Components
The software components of CityWaste Connect include:
Web-based Control Panel: A user-friendly interface accessible through web browsers. It is built using PHP language and uses MySQL database for data storage.

# Getting Started
To set up and use CityWaste Connect, follow these steps:
1.	Hardware Setup: Assemble the microcontroller, RFID module, and SIMCOM 4G LTE chip according to the provided hardware documentation.
2.	Web Application: Deploy the web-based control panel using the provided PHP and MySQL resources. Configure the database connection settings.
3.	RFID Tagging: Fix RFID tags at the doorstep of each waste generator.
4.	Device Initialization: Initialize the device by connecting it to the internet using the SIMCOM 4G LTE chip.
5.	Collection Routes: Configure collection routes and schedules in the web-based control panel.

# Usage
1.	Waste collectors take the device along their designated routes.
2.	The device automatically scans RFID tags at waste generator doorsteps, recording collection data.
3.	Real-time collection data is transmitted to the web-based control panel, providing insights to waste management personnel.
